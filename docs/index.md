# Welcome to OpenDataMap
## What is the OpenDataMap?
The OpenDataMap is a modular map solution for a wide variety of open data formats. The difference to other maps is that the OpenDataMap combines local data from several sources, so that an interested citizen only needs to visit one website for their local data.
